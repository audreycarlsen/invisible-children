        <div class="chatter">The very small number of state-funded youth-shelter beds has fallen nearly by half — to 23 statewide — since 2008, even though the beds in Seattle and Everett are constantly full. Now, the plan to end homelessness for youths and young adults in King County pins its hopes on a variety of alternatives to traditional shelters and transitional housing.</div>

    <div class="quote">"Due to not learning true independence, I struggled to transition into adulthood. I believe if there were classes offered on how to manage money, how to access public utilities, rent-program assistance and the importance of building rental history, then I wouldn’t have become homeless right when I turned 21, leaving extended foster care."</div>

    <div class="quote">"Being a teen myself, I think that this problem hit me especially hard, knowing that if I had been a little less fortunate in life, I could be just another one of the kids in those statistics. It would be really cool to get a movement going that includes high-schoolers raising money."</div>

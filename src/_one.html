  <div class="problem">
    <div class="button">Problem</div> Washington’s child welfare system is mostly closed to adolescents and teenagers. When youths can no longer stay at home and aren’t placed in foster care, they often land on the street, where they are easily victimized.
  </div>
  <div class="solution">
    <div class="button">Solution</div> The Legislature should reopen the door to the child welfare system for these youths with renewed investment in family preservation services and other "upstream" services.

        <div class="chatter">The state system to deal with runaways had three chances to intervene for Brittany, a girl in constant motion between homelessness, detention and a crisis center.

    Editorial writer Jonathan Martin spent several months looking at youth homelessness from all angles, traveling in-state and out to talk with kids, parents, foster parents, social workers, state officials and lawmakers. The result is a series of editorials sharing his findings and suggested remedies. Also included in this examination are guest columns.

    <div class="subhed">Support for this series</div>
    Reporting for this project was made possible with financial support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private, national philanthropic organization that aims to better futures for disadvantaged children in the U.S. The work was done and directed independently of the foundation.
